##Git and Github

Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of software changes.  It allows multiple people to work on the same project without screwing each other up.

Github is a popular website that allows people to back up and share their code.

We'll be using both for this tutorial.  Make an account with Github.  Also download Github for Mac OS X.

```bash
git clone 
```

```bash
git status
```

```bash
git add -A :\
```

```bash
git status
```

```bash
git commit
```
