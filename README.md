#Coding for People

Welcome to the world of computers.  You are now entering uncharted territory.

It's only been 50 years since the invention of what you or I would come to understand as the computer.  And much of the computational technology we humans use on a daily basis is not more than 20, 10, 5, or even a single year old.  The technology you learn in this course is in its teenage years.  Which means once you start, you will find yourself on the frontier of human thought and ability.

Don't be fooled- our journey is anything but modern.  To get a true sense of how and why computers work, we must travel back through centuries of mathematics and philosphy, logic and fantasy.  Ultimately, we will find out that computers are not magical: at every level- if you look hard enough- you can come to understand how they work.  Yet once mastered, the computer can be used to work all types of powerful magic.

This journey is designed for those humans who have little to no experience with the science of computers.  It assumes the human is (a) driven to learn at least something about computers and (b) has at least some experience operating a computer through the consumer's user interface.

Be warned, if you choose to continue, there is no going back.

This tutorial is designed for consumption on a Mac.  Much of it will translate smoothly to a Linux machine, but a disclaimer: I do not write any of this with that in mind. Hopefully someone out there can translate, maybe add a version for Windows.

This tutorial is completely open-source, you may fork, edit, or redistribute the code.  

I do this in my spare time, tips are more than welcome:
