#Coding for People

Welcome to the world of computers.  You are now entering uncharted territory.

It's only been 50 years since the invention of the modern day computer.  And much of the technology we humans use on a daily basis is not more than 20, 10, 5, or even a single year old.  The technology you learn in this course is in its teenage years.  Which means once you start, you will find yourself on the frontier of human thought and ability.

Don't be fooled- our journey is anything but modern.  To get a true sense of how and why computers work, we must travel back through centuries of mathematics and philosphy, logic and fantasy.  Ultimately, we will find out that computers are not magical: at every level- if you look hard enough- you can come to understand how they work.  But once mastered, the computer can be used to work all types of powerful magic.

If you choose to continue, there is no going back.

This tutorial is designed for consumption on a Mac.  Much of it will translate smoothly to a Linux machine, but be warned, I do not write any of this with that in mind.  Maybe someone out there can translate, add a version for Windows.
