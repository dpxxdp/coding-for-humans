#Coding for Humans

Welcome to the world of computers.  You are now entering uncharted territory.

It's only been 50 years since the invention of what you or I would come to understand as the computer.  And much of the computational technology we humans use on a daily basis is not more than 20, 10, 5, or even a single year old.  The technology you learn in this course is in its teenage years.  Which means once you start, you will find yourself on the frontier of human thought and ability.

Don't be fooled- our journey is anything but modern.  To get a true sense of how and why computers work, we must travel back through centuries of mathematics and philosphy, logic and fantasy.  Ultimately, we will find out that computers are not magical: at every level- if you look hard enough- you can come to understand how they work.  Yet once mastered, the computer can be used to work all types of powerful magic.

Be warned: if you choose to continue, there is no going back.

This journey is designed for those humans who have little to no experience with the science of computers.  It assumes the human is (a) driven to learn at least something about computers and (b) has at least some experience operating a computer through the consumer's user interface.

This tutorial is to be used in conjunction with the most expansive knowledge-base ever built: the internet.  When you get stuck on a problem or have a question, Google away.  Be not afraid of forums.  Ask [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming).  Make a [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) account.  Every time you use the internet, you are using the most up-to-date collection of knowledge and educational tools humanity has ever known.  Each of the following chapters is but a launching point into a much more grande universe of ideas.  Spend the most time on the ideas that excite you.  If you learn nothing else, the ability to solve a difficult problem with the entire internet at your disposal is a most worthwhile skill.

With that, let us dive down into the depths of your computer: [Chapter 1](./one/human_meet_computer_1.md)

This tutorial is designed for consumption on a Mac.  Much of it will translate smoothly to a Linux machine, but a disclaimer: I do not write any of this with that in mind. Hopefully someone out there can translate, maybe add a version for Windows.
